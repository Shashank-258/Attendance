# 🎯 Face Recognition Attendance System (Python)

An AI-based Attendance Management System that uses Face Recognition to automatically mark attendance and store it in an Excel sheet.

This project is built using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas, and helps in reducing manual attendance work.

## 🚀 Features
- Face detection using OpenCV
- Face recognition for identifying students
- Automatic attendance marking
- Attendance saved in Excel sheet
- Fast and accurate system
- Easy to use

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Excel (for storing attendance)
- VS Code

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. Capture faces using webcam
2. Recognize the person using stored face data
3. Mark attendance automatically
4. Save attendance with date & time in Excel file
